## Description
To consolidate our learning on the Flutter discipline from FIAP Mobile MBA, we created a random cats and dogs facts app. As the name suggests, this application retrieves random facts about cats and dogs, listing them as well as providing options to select which group user prefers to see. A simple login path was developed to integrate firebase Authentication into the app.

## How to use
The simplest way to use the app is to install the file ``app-release.apk``, located on the root folder of the project, into your device.

The second way is to import the project and integrate it inside your own Firebase Console account, meaning you would need to replace the files containing google services api keys.

The first screen after opening the app for the first time is the Login screen where user is guided with two options: create an account or enter on a created account. After one of the paths is concluded, the facts screen enters displaying 10 random facts about cats and dogs, 5 for each. User can also select which group will be listed as well as enter a fact by touching a card to see its full content.
